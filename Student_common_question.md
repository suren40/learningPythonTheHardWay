# Student Common Question
1. What is the difference between = (single quote) and == (double quote)?
	
	The single quote assigns the value of the right on the left
	The double quote tests whether two things have same value.
2. Can we write x=10 instead of x = 10?
	
	Both are correct syntax the left one is good practise and PEP 8

3. What do you mean by " read the file backward"?

	Reading your file from the end to the start point For example 
	if you have 18 lines of code and you read from line 18 ,17 and 
	so on to 1 then it is reading the file backward.
